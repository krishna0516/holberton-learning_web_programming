          <p>My name is Krishna Patel. I am a 17 year old senior at Career High School. I am from India (my parents were born and raised there) but I was born and raised in the US. I am Quad Lingual, meaning I can fluently speak four languages: English, Hindi, Gujarati, and Urdu beacause Urdu is very similar to Hindi in terms of the way it is spoken. I am currently writing my college essay to hopefully send to Boston University, Boston College, Tufts University, and many more.</p>

          <p>I am apart of a squash team called <a href="http://www.squashhaven.org/">Squash Haven</a>. It is an academically and athletically demanding program. We practice year round, off-season and on-season. The entire team has practice 3 days every week during the school and 5 days a week during the summer. During the school year, the middle schoolers meet every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday and the high schoolers meet every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The team consists of over 100 students from all over New Haven, ranging from 5th graders to 12th grades. Squash Haven continues to support you beyond High school and College as well. Currently, I am working on my college essay with the help of our college director staff member on the team. Besides the academics, we focus a lot on the sport of squash as well. It is a sport similar to racquet ball or tennis. The team competes in multiple tournaments throughtout the season. In 2018, Our girls team placed 21st in the entire country, making it our biggest accomplishment, since that is the highest any of our teams have ranked.

          <p>I have played soccer with my girls high school team founded by a few of friends along with myself our sophomore year. We are a Varsity Girls Soccer Team coached by one of our own teachers, Bob Osborne. We have conditioning during the summer to prepare us for the upcoming season led by the founding girls and practice everyday once school starts until the end of the season.

          <p>I am apart, <a href="http://robosquad558.weebly.com/">FRC Team 558, Elm City Robo Squad</a>. Every season we create a robot to play a game assigned to us. Our team fully builds a robot from the start to finish including coding the robot so it can function and move with the help of controls and sometimes without any human control. The team has qualified for the World Championships held in St. Louis, Missouri and Detroit, Michigan, for the past 6 years. We are extremely competitive when our robot is on the field but, we are just as crazy and fun when it is off the field. The team functions like a family; we call some of our mentors mom and dad as they have taken the roles of our parents outside our home.

Today Holberton School has 6 different locations, two of which are in the US. The school hosted its first girls coding camp in New Haven this year in after expanding beyond Silicon Valley. This camp allowed for me to learn and explore and a brand new coding language (HTML) and build my own website through which I created this site.
